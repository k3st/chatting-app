# Ask for the name of the user
# Print the name of the user in all capital letters for example "Hello USER!"
# Take the 5 numbers from user.
# Using result as the variable perform the following equation: num1**num2/num3+num4%num5
# For example, if the computed result is 12.66667 when printed out, the format should be 12.67
# Print out the result of the equation. Follow the sample output: "Result is: 12.67"
# If the result is equal to or above 100, print out "Yahoo!" else, print out "Yehey!"
